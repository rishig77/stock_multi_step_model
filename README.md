**Project Title:**  Revolutionizing Multi-Step Stock Price Prediction with Hierarchical VAEs and Diffusion Models

**Project Description:** This project tackles the challenge of accurate long-term stock price prediction, a critical task for financial institutions. Traditional models often struggle to capture the complex, noisy dynamics of stock markets, particularly over extended periods.

**My Solution:** I developed a novel approach that combines Hierarchical Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with Diffusion Probabilistic Models. This hybrid model:

 - Learns intricate patterns: The hierarchical VAE extracts underlying patterns from stock market data.
Handles market volatility: Diffusion models simulate and manage stochastic fluctuations by introducing and removing noise.
Key Results:

 - Superior Accuracy: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy and variance reduction.

 - Improved Portfolio Optimization: Generates portfolios with higher Sharpe ratios, demonstrating practical utility for investment strategies.

**Impact:** This project provides a robust solution for financial forecasting, enabling more informed decision-making and better risk management in volatile markets.
